# Basic Stats in Python Student Workbooks

This repository contains the workbooks that you'll use for demonstration and exercises for Akeem's stat's class. To get started with this repository:
<ul>
<li> Click the green "Code" button towards the upper right of the page. 
<li> Use the copy button (the button beside the text) to copy the HTTPS link. It should be the default. 
<li> In VS Code, click the "Source Control" button on the side toolbar. 
<li> Select "Clone Repository" and place your link in the tool bar. 
</ul>

Throughout the class we'll generally work through exercises in these workbooks. Akeem will update and tweak them as the term goes depending on what exactly we end up focusing on. To get the updates, before each class it is advisable to "pull" the updates down from the central server. To do so:
<ul>
<li> In VS Code, with the repository open, click the source control button on the sidebar. 
<li> In the Souce Control column, click the 3 dots to expand the menu. 
<li> Select "Pull" from the menu. Click OK/Yes if there are any pop-ups. 
</ul>

You can also generate your own version of this entire repository on your GitHub site, that is synced with your work on your laptop. From within the Source Control section, attempt to commit your saved changes. You should get an error/message telling you that you dont' have permission and offering you the option to "fork". Choose the fork option. Forking the repository will create your own personal copy that you can work on and publish as your own that is also available on GitHub (if you have the security set as "public", people could theoretically find, then clone and fork your repository). As you work through the semester, every time you "pull" from the main repository you'll get the updates and changes made to the material; every time you "push" or "commit" you'll sync all of the changes you've made (along with the updates from the central repository that you pulled) into the version on your Github. Creating a fork is not mandatory for this repository, but it is a good idea - mainly because it is OK practice, it gives you a backup in case your computer breaks, and presenting your GitHub kind of like a portfolio is common for jobs, so it doesn't hurt to start building some stuff in there. 

Doing this pull will update your copy with any changes made to the source documents, this is part of the magic of version control! Get EXCITED!!
